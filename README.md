# Respawn-Review
Review of the game Respawn
# Details
The name of the game is Respawn
It was made in the Fall 2011 semester at Northwest Vista College
# Summary
Respawn is a platformer that has the player move about the level by dying. The player is equipped with the Respawn Machine which allows the player to respawn whereever the device is. So the player must launch the Respawn Machine in order to cross huge gaps or get through obstacles that they would not be able to pass through.

The game stars a scientist named Seth who creates the Respawn Machhine. He is being chased by his arch nemesis, Chauncy, and his minions.


When I first started the game, the Music was on, but the Sound was not. The Music was also mislabeled as "OFF" when it was on which confused me at first.

At the end of the first level, I respawned next to the red flag, but couldn't move foward until I threw the Respawn Machine.

I found a collision defect near the beginnin of level 2. I tried to die by simply walking foward into the telephone line, but I clipped through and landed on the ground. This happened with the very first telephone wire.
