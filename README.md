# Respawn-Review
Review of the game Respawn
# Details
The name of the game is Respawn
It was made in the Fall 2011 semester at Northwest Vista College
# Summary
Respawn is a platformer that has the player move about the level by dying. The player is equipped with the Respawn Machine which allows the player to respawn whereever the device is. So the player must launch the Respawn Machine in order to cross huge gaps or get through obstacles that they would not be able to pass through.

The game stars a scientist named Seth who creates the Respawn Machhine. He is being chased by his arch nemesis, Chauncy, and his minions.


When I first started the game, the Music was on, but the Sound was not. The Music was also mislabeled as "OFF" when it was on which confused me at first.

At the end of the first level, I respawned next to the red flag, but couldn't move foward until I threw the Respawn Machine.

I found a collision defect near the beginnin of level 2. I tried to die by simply walking foward into the telephone line, but I clipped through and landed on the ground. This happened with the very first telephone wire.

# Final Thoughts
The game was pretty fun. There was a recommended time limit to play the game before starting this review, and I wound up going past the time limit. The music was easily loopable and the puzzles were challenging without being impossible. There were some problems however, as I detailed above, but that did not hurt the experience too much. I couldn't help but feel there was something off, maybe it's due to the player's jump height and the overall weight of the player. He felt heavier that what I was expecting for a platformer, but that can be due to the platformers I'm used to playing. The menus were basic. They performed their function but that was about it. Nothing really stood out about them. Overall the game was fun, it just needs a little more polish.
