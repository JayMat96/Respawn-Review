# Respawn-Review
Review of the game Respawn
# Details
The name of the game is Respawn
It was made in the Fall 2011 semester at Northwest Vista College
# Summary
When I first started the game, the Music was on, but the Sound was not. The Music was also mislabeled as "OFF" when it was on which confused me at first.
At the end of the first level, I respawned next to the red flag, but couldn't move foward until I threw the Respawn Machine.
I found a collision defect near the beginnin of level 2. I tried to die by simply walking foward into the telephone line, but I clipped through and landed on the ground. This happened with the very first telephone wire.
